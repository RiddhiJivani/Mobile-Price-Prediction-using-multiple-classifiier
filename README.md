# Dataset
We have two datasets, testing and training. This training set comprises of 20 attributes and 2001 observations and test set comprises of 21 attributes and 1001 observations, where after preprocessing it is made to 20 attributes. We have mixed dataset i.e Binary as well as Numerical values for our features.
# Summary
Mobile is playing a vital role in human life. Mobile business has become a major business. Our project is on mobile price prediction. This project comprises of different data mining techniques with different partition size for the samples. In this Project, based on the mobile Specification like Battery power, 3G enabled, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ram etc. we are predicting Price range of the mobile. For first we have preprocessed the data by removing the unnecessary columns and initializing various classifiers and fitting them to these samples with proper performance measures, thereby predicting the mobile price by choosing the best data mining model with high performance values. By visualizing the attributes individually and comparing each attribute with price range. This kind of prediction will help companies estimate price of mobiles to give tough competition to other mobile manufacturer. It will be useful for Consumers to verify that they are paying best price for a mobile. For this we have used Decision tree, K-Neighboring, Support Vector machine, Linear discriminant analysis, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes classifiers with different split ratios.The mobile price is a very important factor in shaping up the market of a mobile company. So, it would be advantageous for a company to possess a business model which will accurately predict price of any mobile that is newly launched in the market ,thereby the company can regulate the price of their own product, so as to boost their sales. The main goal of this project is to find the best accurate model.
# Conclusion
Classifiers                  Accuracy
Decision Tree                  0.808
Support Vector Machine         0.954
K nearest Neighbor             0.924
Gaussian NB                    0.842
Random Forest                  0.876
Linear Discriminant Analysis   0.954

This prediction will help companies estimate price of mobiles to give tough competition to other mobile manufacturer. It will be useful for Consumers to verify that they are paying best price for a mobile. We have got the best accuracy for dataset with Support Vector machine model as well as with Linear Discriminant analysis model which is nearly 95%.
